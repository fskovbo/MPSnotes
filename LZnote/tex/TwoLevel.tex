\chapter{Optimal Control of Two-Level System}
In order to illustrate the use of quantum optimal control it was applied to the two-level Landau-Zener system with the goal of transferring the initial state $\ket{\psi _0} = \ket{0}_z$ into the target-state $\ket{\psi _{\mathrm{target}}} = \ket{1}_z$. In this model the Hamiltonian in question is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:LZ_ham}
	\hat{H} = \Omega \hat{\sigma}_x + u \hat{\sigma}_z \; ,
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_i$'s are Pauli matrices. Thus, the control adjusts the rotation around the z-axis in the Bloch sphere representation, while $\Omega$ represents a constant rotational speed around the x-axis giving rise to Rabi oscillations.

\section{Analytical Approach}
The two-state Landau-Zener problem is widely used in physics and was chosen because an analytical solution exists for arbitrary initial and final states, as detailed in [Gerhard C. Hegerfeldt. Driving at the quantum speed limit: Optimal control of a
two-level system. Phys. Rev. Lett., 111:260501, Dec 2013]. In this article, however, the control $u(t)$ is allowed to change arbitrarily. Say we wanted to evolve an initial state,
\begin{equation}
\lvert \psi_0 \rangle = \cos{\left(\frac{\theta_0}{2}\right)} \lvert 0 \rangle + e^{i\phi_0}\sin{\left(\frac{\theta_0}{2}\right)}\lvert 1 \rangle,
\end{equation}
to a final state,
\begin{equation}
\lvert \psi_T \rangle = \cos{\left(\frac{\theta_T}{2}\right)} \lvert 0 \rangle + e^{i\phi_T}\sin{\left(\frac{\theta_T}{2}\right)}\lvert 1 \rangle,
\end{equation}
at time $T$, seeking to find the lowest $T$ for which such a transition is possible.

In [Gerhard C. Hegerfeldt. Driving at the quantum speed limit: Optimal control of a
two-level system. Phys. Rev. Lett., 111:260501, Dec 2013], the optimal time-development operator is found to be,
\begin{equation}
\hat{U}_H(T,0)=e^{-i\phi_T\hat{\sigma}_z}e^{-i\Omega\hat{\sigma}_xT}e^{i\phi_0\hat{\sigma}_z},
\end{equation}
corresponding to a control consisting of two Dirac delta function pulses separated by a timespan $T$ in which $u(T)=0$ and the QSL is $T_{\mathrm{QSL}}=\lvert\frac{\theta_T-\theta_0}{2\Omega}\rvert$. In our case, $\lvert\psi_0\rangle=\lvert 0\rangle$, $\lvert\psi_T\rangle=\lvert 0\rangle$, so $T_{\mathrm{QSL}}=\pi/2\Omega$ and $\phi_T=\phi_0=0$. Note that boundary conditions on $u(t)$ are irrelevant when $u(t)$ is allowed to consist of delta functions and, in particular, step functions.

%Introducing the unit vector
%\begin{equation}
%\hat{n}=\begin{pmatrix}\Omega\\0\\u\end{pmatrix}\frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega^2+u^2}}
%\end{equation}
%the Hamiltonian in eq. \ref{eq:LZ_ham} can be written
%\begin{equation}

%\end{equation}
%\hat{H}=\hat{n}\hat{\sigma}\sqrt{\Omega^2+u^2}
%\end{equation}
%with $\hat{sigma}=(\hat{\sigma}_x,\hat{\sigma}_y,\hat{\sigma}_z)^T$, and $\hat{n}\hat{\sigma}$ rotating $\lvert \psi\rangle$ around the vector $\hat{n}$ on the Bloch sphere. 

\section{Numerical Approach}
For the optimization a steepest descent algorithm was used, such the control was updated at each iteration as
\begin{equation}
	u(t)^{(i+1)} = u(t)^{(i)} - \alpha \nabla \hat{J}(u(t)) \; ,
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ was found at each iteration using a line search.
In these calculations $\Omega = 1$ was chosen along with the boundary limits of the control $u(0) = 0$ and $u(T) = 2 T$. Furthermore, $\gamma = 0$ was chosen, as the solutions were sufficiently smooth without requiring any penalizing.\\
Note, that for the most direct transfer of the initial state to the target state $u = 0$ would be the optimal solution, as described in the previous section. $\hat{\sigma}_x$ would rotate the initial state directly into the target state, however, due to the choice of boundaries of the control, this solution is not viable. Thus, by optimizing the control one is adjusting the rotation around the x-axis, such that $\ket{\psi (T)} = \ket{\psi _{\mathrm{target}}}$, while $u(T) = 2 T$.

\section{Optimization for $T = \frac{\pi}{2}$ } 
An estimate for the QSL of this system can be made using the analytical solution of $u(t) = 0$. Expressing the initial and target state as a linear combination of eigenstates of the $\hat{\sigma}_x$ operator yields
\begin{align}
	\ket{0}_z &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \ket{1}_x - \ket{0}_x \right) \\ 
	\ket{1}_z &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \ket{1}_x + \ket{0}_x \right) \; .
\end{align}
Thus, for $\Omega = 1$ and $u(t) = 0$ the Hamiltonian is constant, whereby time evolution can be performed easily
\begin{align}
	\ket{\psi (t)} &= e^{-i \hat{\sigma}_x t} \ket{\psi _0} \nonumber \\
	&= e^{-i \hat{\sigma}_x t } \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \ket{1}_x - \ket{0}_x \right) \nonumber \\
	&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{-i t} \ket{1}_x - e^{i t} \ket{0}_x \right) \nonumber \\
	&= e^{-i t} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \ket{1}_x - e^{2 i t} \ket{0}_x \right) \; . \label{eq:timeEvoTwoLevel}
\end{align}
From equation \ref{eq:timeEvoTwoLevel} one sees that $\ket{\psi (T)} = \ket{\psi _{\mathrm{target}}}$ for $T = \frac{\pi}{2}$. Of course in this model, $u(t) \neq 0$ for all times $t$, and solution times $T$ must therefore be greater than or equal to $\pi/2$.

Indeed, performing the optimization for $T = \frac{\pi}{2}$ yields a complete transfer of the initial state into the target state, while $T_1 < T$ fails to converge. Starting with an initial control varying linearly, the optimized control is very different as seen in figure \ref{fig:control}: For the first third of the timespan it remains at zero, which, as described earlier, is the optimal solution when neglecting boundaries. But since it is required that $u(T) = 2 T$ and that $u(t)$ be continuous, the control first decreases to compensate for the following sharp increase.
The resulting path on the Bloch sphere is displayed in figure \ref{fig:path}. Had the control not decreased (resulting in a negative rotation around the z-axis) first, the large upswing in the end would have made the state miss its target. Consequently, the faster an increase in the control allowed, the lesser the need is for the preceeding negative rotation to correct the trajectory. The limit of this increase would be $u(t)=0$ for all (arbitrarily small) timesteps except the last, where it jumps to $u(T)=2T$, as is the analytical solution.

Just how smooth the transfer between the initial and target state is is made clear in figure \ref{fig:population}, where the population inversion, $w = |\braket{1|\psi}|^2 - |\braket{0|\psi}|^2$, is plotted. Although the path on the Bloch sphere is not completely straight, the population inversion is showing the same characteristics as the Rabi oscillations ($|\braket{1|\psi}|^2 \propto \sin \left( \Omega t / 2 \right)$). However, as $T$ is equal to half the period of the Rabi oscillation, the similarity between the solution and Rabi oscillations is to be expected.
Finally, figure \ref{fig:cost} illustrates, how the algorithm finds increasingly better solutions, as the reduced cost functional is gradually decreasing. Since $\gamma = 0$, one can read the fidelity directly of the figure as $F = 1 - 2 J$. Thus, this solution yields a fidelity $F \sim 0.999$, however, since the cost has not yet converged on this figure, an even higher fidelity could be reached with more iterations of the algorithm.

As described earlier, the GRAPE method will produce a solution, which steers the initial into the target state at $t = T$. Thus, running the algorithm for $T_2 > T_{\mathrm{QSL}}$ should produce a more indirect solution.
This is indeed the case, as seen in figure \ref{fig:control2}, where an Gaussian-like profile has been added on top of the previous solution in order to reach the target state at the desired time. This addition of course leads to a more indirect path, as illustrated in figure \ref{fig:path2}. Hence, the population inversion of figure \ref{fig:population2} is no longer similar to that of a Rabi oscillation.

Nevertheless, it should be noted that this is a completely valid solution, as it meets all the set requirements.
