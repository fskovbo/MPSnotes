\chapter{Quantum Optimal Control Theory}
The fundamental problem of Quantum Optimal Control Theory is to steer the dynamics of a quantum system in a desired way through external fields \cite{Rice2000,Shapiro2003}. Often, the goal is the transfer from an initial state, $\ket{\psi_0}$, to the desired target-state, $\ket{\psi_{\mathrm{target}}}$. The fields responsible for controlling the dynamics of the system are parametrised by a set of control parameters or functions. Optimal control theory determines the parameters, which leads to the desired dynamics of the system \cite{Werschnik2007}.\\ 
In control problems, the Hamiltonian of the system is given as
\begin{equation}
	\hat{H} = \hat{H}_0 + \hat{H}_I = \hat{H}_0 + \sum_{n = 1}^{m}  \hat{H}_n (u_n(t)) \; ,
	\label{eq:ControlHamiltonians}
\end{equation} 
where $\hat{H}_0$ is an uncontrollable drift of the Hamiltonian, $\hat{H}_n$ are the controllable fields, and $u_n(t)$ are the control functions or parameters. A quantum system like this is completely controllable if every unitary operator $\hat{U}$ is accessible from the identity operator $\hat{I}$ via a path $\gamma (t) = \hat{U}(t, t_0)$ satisfying \cite{Schirmer2001}
\begin{equation}
	i \partial_t \hat{U}(t, t_0) = \left( \hat{H}_0 + \hat{H}_I \right) \hat{U}(t, t_0) \; .
\end{equation} 
For an $N$-dimensional Hilbert spaces, a sufficient condition for complete controllability of a quantum system is that the Lie algebra generated by the Hamiltonians in eq. \eqref{eq:ControlHamiltonians},
\begin{equation}
	L_0 = \mathrm{Lie} \left( i \hat{H}_0, i \hat{H}_1 , \ldots , i \hat{H}_m \right) \; ,
\end{equation}
is of dimension $N^2$ \cite{Ramakrishna1995}.\\
Extending these conditions to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and constrained controls is non-trivial \cite{Huang1983}. Therefore, no calculations of the Lie dimensions will be performed for the control problems presented in this thesis.


\section{The Gradient-Ascent Pulse Engineering Method - GRAPE} \label{sec:GRAPE}
The control problem presented in this thesis is steering the system from an initial state in the Superfluid phase to a target-state in the Mott-Insulator phase. This is achieved by varying the lattice depth, which therefore can be considered the control parameter. Hence, the optimal control problem can be stated as follows: 
Suppose the system is initially described by the state $\ket{\psi_0} = \ket{\psi (0)}$, and the potential is varied in the time interval $[ 0 , T]$. The goal is finding the set of control parameters, $\boldsymbol{u}(t)$, which brings the initial state as close as possible to the target state, $\ket{\psi_{\mathrm{target}}}$. This is formulated in terms of a cost function
\begin{equation}
	J_T = \frac{1}{2} \left( 1-|\braket{\psi_{\mathrm{target}} | \psi (T)}|^2 \right) \; ,
	\label{eq:infidelityCost}
\end{equation}
which is given as half the infidelity between the target and the state at $t=T$. The cost function becomes zero, when the terminal state matches the target state up to an arbitrary phase. Hence, the optimal control problem can be formulated as a minimization problem of eq. \eqref{eq:infidelityCost} \cite{Jager2014}.\\
Experimentally, large variations in the control parameter is often hard to achieve. Therefore, an extra term is often added to the cost function, which penalizes strong variations in the control. The new cost function reads
\begin{equation}
	J = J_T + J_R = J_T + \frac{\gamma}{2} \sum_{n=1}^{m} \int_{0}^{T} \left( \pdv{u_n}{t} \right)^2 \mathrm{d}t \; ,
	\label{eq:grapeCost}
\end{equation}
where $\gamma$ weighs the relative importance between matching states and smoothness of the control \cite{Jager2014}. As the state transfer is considered the highest priority, $\gamma$ is set as $\gamma \ll 1$, such that $J_T$ dominates the cost function of eq. \eqref{eq:grapeCost}.\\

A powerful way of performing optimal control is through the Gradient-Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE) method. Through GRAPE, the gradient of the cost function \eqref{eq:grapeCost} can be evaluated and used to update the existing set of controls \cite{Khaneja2005}. Thereby, one achieves an optimization of the cost function.\\
The gradient of the cost function can be derived in multiple ways. A common method \cite{Hohenester2007, Winckel2008, BECcontrol} is introducing a Lagrange multiplier, which forces the dynamics to obey the Schr√∂dinger equations. The derivation utilizes functional derivatives, as time, $\ket{\psi (t)}$, and the Lagrange multiplier are considered continuous functions. Later, the functions are discretized to perform numerical computations. Although this procedure is fairly easy, higher order correction terms of the gradient are absent due to the continuity of the functions. Here, an alternative derivation following \cite{Khaneja2005, deFouquieres2011} is presented in which the discretization is introduced immediately. \\
Assume the transfer time, $T$, is discretized in $M$ equal steps, $\Delta t = T/M$. Therefore, the control become similarly discretized as
\begin{equation}
	u_n = \left( u_n (t_1) , \ldots , u_n (t_M)  \right) \equiv \left( u_n (1) , \ldots , u_n (M)  \right) \; .
\end{equation}
Likewise, the time-evolution of the system during the time step $j$ is given by the propagator
\begin{equation}
	\hat{\mathcal{U}}_j \equiv \hat{\mathcal{U}} (u(t_j)) = \exp \bigg\{ -i \left(  \sum_{n = 1}^{m}  \hat{H}_n (u_n(j))  \right) \Delta t \bigg\} \; . 
\end{equation} 
Thereby, the cost function \eqref{eq:grapeCost} becomes
\begin{equation}
	J = \frac{1}{2} \left( 1 - |\braket{\psi_{\mathrm{target}} | \prod_{j = 1}^{M} \hat{\mathcal{U}}_j | \psi (0)}|^2 \right) + \frac{\gamma}{2} \sum_{n = 1}^{m} \sum_{j = 1}^{M-1} \left( \frac{\Delta u_n (j)}{\Delta t} \right)^2 \Delta t \; ,
	\label{eq:discreteCost}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta u_n (j) =  u_n (j+1) - u_n (j)$. The full gradient of the cost, $\nabla J(\boldsymbol{u})$, is a vector of partial derivatives $\frac{\partial J(\boldsymbol{u})}{\partial u_n (j)}$.\\
First, consider the derivative of the regularization
\begin{align}
	\frac{\partial J_R}{\partial u_n (j)} &= \frac{\gamma}{2} \left( 2 \frac{u_n (j) - u_n (j-1)}{\Delta t^2} - 2 \frac{u_n (j+1) - u_n (j)}{\Delta t^2} \right) \Delta t \nonumber \\
	&= \frac{\gamma}{\Delta t} \left( 2 u_n (j) - u_n (j+1) - u_n (j-1) \right) \; . \label{eq:regularizationGrad}
\end{align}
The part of the gradient related to the regularization depends only on the control, whereby it can be calculated without considering the state of the system.\\ 
Next, consider the derivative of $J_T$. Defining the transfer probability amplitude $\tau \equiv \braket{\psi_{\mathrm{target}} | \psi (T)}$, the derivative of the final infidelity with respect to the control can be written as 
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial J_T}{\partial u_n (j)} = - \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial}{\partial u_n (j)}  \tau^* \tau   = - \Re \left( \tau^* \frac{\partial \tau}{\partial u_n (j)} \right) \; .
	\label{eq:dJTdu}
\end{equation}
From eq. \eqref{eq:dJTdu} it is evident that the derivative of the infidelity only depends on the derivative of the transfer probability amplitude, $\frac{\partial \tau}{\partial u_n (j)}$. This derivative can be rewritten as
\begin{align}
	\frac{\partial \tau}{\partial u_n (j)} &= \frac{\partial }{\partial u_n (j)} \braket{\psi_{\mathrm{target}} | \prod_{j = 1}^{M} \hat{\mathcal{U}}_j | \psi (0)} \nonumber \\
	&= \bra{\psi_{\mathrm{target}}} \hat{\mathcal{U}}_M \ldots \hat{\mathcal{U}}_{j+1} \frac{\partial \hat{\mathcal{U}}_{j}}{\partial u_n (j)} \hat{\mathcal{U}}_{j-1} \ldots \hat{\mathcal{U}}_{1} \ket{\psi (0)}
	\label{eq:dcdu}
\end{align}
Multiplying eq. \eqref{eq:dcdu} with $\tau^*$ to recreate the result of eq. \eqref{eq:dJTdu} yields
\begin{align}
	\tau^* \frac{\partial \tau}{\partial u_n (j)} &=  \braket{\psi(T) | \psi_{\mathrm{target}}} \Braket{\psi_{\mathrm{target}} | \prod_{j' = j +1}^{M} \hat{\mathcal{U}}_{j '} \frac{\partial \hat{\mathcal{U}}_{j}}{\partial u_n (j)} \prod_{j' = 1}^{ j-1} \hat{\mathcal{U}}_{j '} | \psi (0)} \\
	&= i \Braket{\chi (T) | \prod_{j' = j +1}^{M} \hat{\mathcal{U}}_{j '} \frac{\partial \hat{\mathcal{U}}_{j}}{\partial u_n (j)} \prod_{j' = 1}^{ j-1} \hat{\mathcal{U}}_{j '} | \psi (0)} \\
	&= i \Braket{\chi (t_j) |  \frac{\partial \hat{\mathcal{U}}_{j}}{\partial u_n (j)} | \psi (t_{j-1})} \; ,
	\label{eq:gradientForBack}
\end{align}
where $\ket{\chi (T)} \equiv i \ket{\psi_{\mathrm{target}}} \braket{\psi_{\mathrm{target}} | \psi (T)}$ is the projection of the final state unto the target state. Notice how in eq. \eqref{eq:gradientForBack} the state $\ket{\chi (T)}$ has been propagated backwards in time.\\ 
The derivative of the propagator, $\hat{\mathcal{U}}_{j}$, is non-trivial, due to possible non-commutativity between the Hamiltonian and its derivative. This results in a series of higher order corrections to the derivative of propagator.
Expanding the propagator as a Taylor series before taking the derivative gives
\begin{align}
	\frac{\partial \hat{\mathcal{U}}_{j}}{\partial u_n (j)} &= \frac{\partial}{\partial u_n (j)}  \exp \left( -i \hat{H} \Delta t \right) \nonumber \\
	&= \sum_{p = 0}^{\infty} \frac{( -i \Delta t  )^p}{p!} \frac{\partial \hat{H}^p}{\partial u_n (j)} \; .  
	\label{eq:derivTaylorExp}
\end{align}
As mentioned before the Hamiltonian may not commute with its derivative. Therefore, one must be careful when taking the derivative of $\hat{H}^p$. Retaining the ordering of the operators while taking the derivative yields
\begin{align}
	\frac{\partial \hat{\mathcal{U}}_{j}}{\partial u_n (j)} &= \sum_{p=1}^{\infty} \frac{ \left( -i \Delta t \right) ^p }{p!} \sum_{q=0}^{p-1} \hat{H}^q \frac{\partial \hat{H}}{\partial u_n (j)} \hat{H}^{p-q-1} \nonumber \\
	&= \sum_{p=0}^{\infty} \sum_{q=0}^{\infty} \frac{A^p B A^q}{(p+q+1)!} \; , \label{eq:derivTaylorExp2}
\end{align} 
where $A = -i \hat{H} \Delta t$ and $B = -i \partial \hat{H}/\partial u_n (j) \Delta t$ have been defined for notational convenience. Through the standard relations of the gamma function, $\Gamma (z)$, one can derive the identity
\begin{equation}
	\frac{1}{(p+q+1)!} = \frac{1}{p! q !} \int_{0}^{1} (1-\alpha)^p \alpha^q \mathrm{d}\alpha \; .
\end{equation}
Thereby eq. \eqref{eq:derivTaylorExp2} can be expressed as
\begin{align}
	\frac{\partial \hat{\mathcal{U}}_{j}}{\partial u_n (j)} &= \sum_{p=0}^{\infty} \sum_{q=0}^{\infty} \frac{A^p B A^q}{p! q !}  \int_{0}^{1} (1-\alpha)^p \alpha^q \mathrm{d}\alpha \nonumber \\
	&= \int_{0}^{1} \sum_{p=0}^{\infty} \sum_{q=0}^{\infty} \frac{(A (1- \alpha))^p}{p!} B \frac{(A \alpha)^q}{q!}  \mathrm{d}\alpha \nonumber \\
	&= \int_{0}^{1} e^{ (1- \alpha) A} B e^{ \alpha A} \mathrm{d}\alpha \nonumber \\
	 &= e^A \int_{0}^{1} e^{ - \alpha A} B e^{ \alpha A} \mathrm{d}\alpha \; , \label{eq:eq:derivTaylorExp3}
\end{align}
where the expansion of the exponential function has been used to eliminate the sums. Although eq. \eqref{eq:eq:derivTaylorExp3} looks rather simple, however, evaluating the integral in its current form is a fairly hard task. Instead, the integral can be explicitly solved by applying the Baker‚ÄìCampbell‚ÄìHausdorff expansion 
\begin{equation}
	e^X Y e^{-X} = \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} \frac{ [ X,Y  ]_k }{k!} = Y + [ X,Y  ] + \frac{1}{2!} [ X , [ X,Y  ]] + \frac{1}{3!} [X, [ X , [ X,Y  ]]  ] + ...
\end{equation}
where $[ X , Y ]_k = [ X ,[ X , Y]]_{k-1}$ and $[X,Y]_0 = Y$ is the definition of the recursive commutator \cite{Wilcox1967}. Thus, eq. \eqref{eq:eq:derivTaylorExp3} reads
\begin{align}
	\frac{\partial \hat{\mathcal{U}}_{j}}{\partial u_n (j)} &=  e^A \int_{0}^{1} \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty } \alpha^{k+1} \frac{(-1)^k}{k!} [ A,B  ]_k \mathrm{d}\alpha \nonumber \\
	&= e^A  \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty }  \frac{(-1)^k}{(k+1)!} [ A,B  ]_k \; .
\end{align}
Inserting this final expression for the derivative of the propagator into eq. \eqref{eq:dJTdu}, one finds the exact derivative of the infidelity 
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial J_T}{\partial u_n (j)} &=  - \Re  \Braket{\chi (t_j) | i e^{-i \hat{H} \Delta t}  \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty }  \frac{(-1)^k}{(k+1)!} \left[ -i \hat{H} \Delta t , -i \frac{\partial \hat{H}}{\partial u_n (j)} \Delta t  \right]_k | \psi (t_{j-1})}  \nonumber \\
	&=  - \Re  \Braket{\chi (t_{j-1}) | \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty }  \frac{i^{k+1} \Delta t^{k+1}}{(k+1)!} \left[ \hat{H} , \frac{\partial \hat{H}}{\partial u_n (j)}  \right]_k | \psi (t_{j-1})}  \; . \label{eq:higherOrderGradient}
\end{align}
For small time-steps the higher order corrections can be neglected, however, choosing a larger time-step reduces the run-time of the time-evolution, which is critical when describing many-body systems. Therefore, including higher order contributions increases the accuracy, whereby larger time-steps can be employed. Computing the higher order corrections can be done efficiently by analytically deriving the commutators beforehand. The increase in accuracy achieved depends on the system, as it is determined by the commutator $[ \hat{H} , \partial \hat{H} / \partial u_n (j) ]$ and how the propagator, $\hat{\mathcal{U}}_{j}$, is constructed. In section \ref{sec:modTMDRG} an alternative propagator is constructed using the Suzuki-Trotter expansion, which causes the gradient to be exact to zeroth order.\\
Finally, combining the derivatives of eq. \eqref{eq:regularizationGrad} and \eqref{eq:higherOrderGradient} produces the entries of the gradient vector for the cost function
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial J (\boldsymbol{u})}{\partial u_n (j)}  = - \Re \Braket{\chi (t_{j-1}) | \left( i \frac{\partial \hat{H}}{\partial u_n (j)} \Delta t + \mathrm{h.o.} \right)  | \psi (t_{j-1})}  + \frac{\gamma}{\Delta t} \left( 2 u_n (j) - u_n (j+1) - u_n (j-1) \right) \; .
	\label{eq:costGradient}
\end{equation}
Here $\mathrm{h.o.}$ denotes all higher order terms ($k > 0$).\\ 

Through the analytically derived gradient, the cost can be iteratively updated using gradient-based optimization methods until a desired threshold is reached. This forms the framework of the Gradient-Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE) algorithm \cite{Khaneja2005}, which is summarised below:

\begin{algorithm}
\begin{algorithmic}
\caption{GRAPE Algorithm}
\State Choose initial control $\boldsymbol{u}^{(1)}$.
\While{$ J > J_{\mathrm{threshold}}$}
	\State Calculate $\ket{\psi (t_k)} = \prod_{j=1}^{k} \hat{\mathcal{U}}_j \ket{\psi (0)}$ for $k = 1 \ldots M$.
	\State Calculate $\ket{\chi (t_k)} = \prod_{j=M}^{k} \hat{\mathcal{U}}_{j}^{\dag} \ket{\chi (T)}$ for $k = M \ldots 1$. 
	\State Evaluate $\frac{\partial J}{\partial u_n (k)}$ for $k = 1 \ldots M$ and $n = 1 \ldots m$ according to eq. \eqref{eq:costGradient}.
	\State Update controls using gradient such that $J^{(i + 1)} < J^{(i)}$. 
\EndWhile
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
The computations are performed under the boundary conditions
\begin{align}
	\boldsymbol{u}(0) &= \text{fixed value} \label{eq:firstBound} \\
	\boldsymbol{u}(T) &= \text{fixed value} \\
	\ket{\psi (0)} &= \ket{\psi_0} \\
	\ket{\chi (T)} &= -i \ket{\psi_{\mathrm{target}}} \braket{\psi_{\mathrm{target}} | \psi (T)} \; .  \label{eq:lastBound}
\end{align}
Figure \ref{fig:ControlUpdate} illustrates an update step of the controls such that the cost function is reduced.
\begin{figure}[!h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\columnwidth]{Figures/ControlUpdate.pdf} 
	\caption{ \textit{Visualisation of update step $i \to i+1$ the control $\boldsymbol{u}^{(i)}$ resulting in a decreased cost function.}}
	\label{fig:ControlUpdate} 
\end{figure} 
Although the starting guess of the control, $\boldsymbol{u}^{(1)}$, can be completely random, both faster convergence and lower convergence value is achieved by choosing a good starting seed. Clearly, there is no guarantee that the algorithm will converge to the global optimum, as it is based on a gradient ascent procedure \cite{Khaneja2005}. Nevertheless, the algorithm can be made to search a large portion of the parameter space by executing it multiple time for various seeds.  


\section{Gradient-Optimization Using Parametrization - GROUP} \label{sec:GROUP}
The convergence rate of optimal control sequences has been shown to be greatly improved by employing gradient-based methods, such as GRAPE, for updating the control \cite{Jager2014}.
One of the disadvantages of GRAPE is the dimension for the optimization. As the duration of the control pulse is discretised into $M$ time-steps, the control at each of these steps must be optimized. For long durations or small time-steps the resulting dimension of the optimization ($M$) will be very large. One can consider this type of control parametrisation having too many degrees of freedom for the optimization. 
However, by employing a proper parametrisation of the control, the optimization dimension can be drastically reduced \cite{Winckel2008}.\\
The typical choice is employing a chopped basis, which parametrises the control as
\begin{equation}
	u(t) = u_0 (t) + S(t) \sum_{n=1}^{N} c_n f_n (t) \; , \label{eq:controlParametrization}
\end{equation}   
where $f_n$ are the basis functions. In addition, $u_0 (t)$ is the initial control function, and $S (t)$ is a shape function enforcing the boundary conditions of the control, whereby $S(0) = S(T) = 0$ CITE JJ ARTIKEL. The shape function used throughout this thesis consists of two steep sigmoids oriented such that $S$ is unit for most time steps. In the chopped basis the coefficients $c_n$ are optimized rather than the full control, $u(t)$. The basis functions, $f_n$, must be chosen based on physical insight of the system. For the control problem discussed in this thesis, employing a basis of sine functions has proven itself useful, as the sine functions are excellent at describing the smoothly varying control pulses desired CITE JJ. Thus, the basis functions read $f_n = \sin \left( \frac{\omega_n t}{T} \right)$, where $\omega_n = n \pi$.
An extension of this type of chopped basis was done in \cite{Doria2011,Caneva2011crab}, introducing random shifts to the frequencies resulting in the Chopped RAndom Basis or \textsc{CRAB}. In recent years the \textsc{CRAB} parametrisation has been used together with the Nelder-Mead hill climbing algorithm to solve various control problems \cite{Doria2011,Caneva2011,FrankBloch,Lloyd2014}.\\
The great advantage of employing a reduced basis representation is the drastic reduction in the optimization space, whereby the optimal control can be found much more efficiently. However, artificial minima can be introduced, if the chosen basis is incapable of spanning the part of the optimization space containing the optimal solutions \cite{Rach2015}. Hence, the chopped basis dimension, $N$, must be chosen not too small.\\

The Gradient-Optimization Using Parametrization or \textsc{GROUP} algorithm introduced in JJ CITE combined the chopped basis representation with the gradient based \textsc{GRAPE} algorithm. This of course alters the gradient of the cost functional described in eq. \eqref{eq:costGradient}. The new gradient can be derived using the chain rule
\begin{align}
	\frac{\partial J (\boldsymbol{c})}{\partial c_n} &= \sum_{m = 1}^{M} \frac{\partial J }{\partial u(t_m)} \frac{\partial u(t_m)}{\partial c_n} \nonumber \\
	&= \sum_{m = 1}^{M} \frac{\partial J }{\partial u(t_m)} S(t_m) f_n(t_m) \; , \label{eq:GROUPgradient} 
\end{align}
where only a single control, $u$, has been chosen for cleaner notation. The gradient in \textsc{GROUP} is more complicated than in \textsc{GRAPE} ($\frac{\partial J }{\partial u(t_m)}$, see eq. \eqref{eq:costGradient}). However, the cost of computing the gradient is still dominated by the evaluation of $\frac{\partial J }{\partial u(t_m)}$, as this requires two time-evolutions for the full duration, $T$. Therefore, the chopped basis representation reduces the dimension of the optimization space, thereby reducing the number of elements in the cost gradient, while causing a negligible increase in the computational difficulty of computing the gradient.
In JJREF a comparison between different optimization algorithms for optimal control showed that \textsc{GROUP} outperformed both \textsc{GRAPE} and Nelder-Mead with \textsc{CRAB} in term of fidelity reached and number of function evaluations required.

\subsection{Alteration of constraints through GROUP}
Although GROUP drastically reduces the number of optimization parameters, it comes with the cost of a large increase in constraints.\\
Consider the non-parametrized optimization problem discretized in time. In this case the problem is subjected to the boundaries of eq. \eqref{eq:firstBound}-\eqref{eq:lastBound}. Furthermore, a set of constraints of the control is often needed. Consider the specific case of the control system being a lattice system described by the Bose-Hubbard model and the control being the lattice depth. A minimum value of the control is required, as the lattice depth must be near the tight-binding limit for the model to remain a good description of the system. This constraint must be enforced at all times. In addition to this, an upper limit of the control may be desired to restrict the interval in which the solution is searched for. Thus, the constraints of the optimization problem reads 
\begin{equation}
	 u_{min} \leq u(i) \leq u_{max} \quad \forall i \; .
\end{equation}

Employing the GROUP algorithm causes a parametrization of the control, eq. \eqref{eq:controlParametrization}, which in turn alters the constraints. Most gradient-based optimization algorithms require the Jacobian of the constraints in addition to the gradient of the objective function. Interior point methods, which is the algorithm of choice for solving the control problems described in this thesis, are without exception. Thus, one must also consider the alteration of the Jacobian, which has elements of the general form $\boldsymbol{J}_{ij} = \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j}$.
Since the constraint function is simply the time discretized control itself, the Jacobian is given by
\begin{equation}
	\boldsymbol{J}_{ij} = \frac{\partial u(i)}{\partial c_j} = S(i) f_j (i) \; .
\end{equation}
Thus, the Jacobian of the constraints has $M * N$ entries, where $M$ is the number of time steps, and $N$ is the dimension of the optimization space. However, these elements are fast to retrieve, as they remain constant throughout the optimization. 


\section{Interior Point Method} \label{sec:IntPoint}
Through the gradient of the cost functional, the control functions can be iteratively updated yielding an improved cost. The update of the control functions can be done using various hill-climbing methods.
Interior point methods are modified versions of Newtons method for bound, constrained problems. The methods approach the solution from within the feasible region and provides efficient performance while having better theoretical properties than the standard simplex method \cite{wright}.\\

Here, a linear version of the method will be derived, however, the formalism can easily be extended to non-linear problems \cite{wright}.
Consider the general minimization problem
 \begin{align*}
	\min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} \;  & \; c^T x \\
	\text{subject to} \;  & \; A x = b  \\
							& \; x \geq 0 \; ,
\end{align*}
which can be derived from any linear problem through slack variables that transform inequality constraints into equality constraints at the cost of introducing extra variables \cite{ipopt}.

\subsection{Karush‚ÄìKuhn‚ÄìTucker conditions}
A central concept in mathematical optimization is the Karush‚ÄìKuhn‚ÄìTucker (KKT) conditions, which are first-order conditions for a solution of a nonlinear problem to be an optimum. The KKT conditions allow inequality constraints, whereby they are more general than Lagrange multipliers. 
\begin{theorem}
	Suppose that $x^*$ is a local solution of the objective function $f \; : \; \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ with respect to a collection of constraints $\{ c_i(x)  \}_{i=1}^{m}$, where $c_i \; : \; \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$. Let $\mathcal{L}$ be the Lagrangian of the problem. If the subset of the equality constraints $\{ c_i(x) \in \mathcal{E}\}$ has the property that $\{ \nabla c_i(x^*)\}$ is linear independent, then a vector of Lagrange multipliers, $\lambda^*$, exists for which the following holds:
	\begin{subequations}	
	\begin{align}
		\nabla_x \mathcal{L}(x^*,\lambda^*) &= 0 \; ,  \\
		c_i(x^*) &= 0 \; , \qquad \forall i \\
		\lambda_{i}^* &\geq 0 \; , \qquad \forall i \in \mathcal{I} \\
		\lambda_{i}^* c_i(x^*) &= 0 \; , \qquad \forall i \in \mathcal{E} \cup \mathcal{I}
	\end{align}
	\end{subequations}	
	where $\mathcal{E}$ and $\mathcal{I}$ denote the equality and inequality subspaces respectively \cite{wright}.  
\end{theorem}
The KKT conditions is a way of determining, whether a point is an optimum. If $x^*$ satisfies the conditions, its objective value must be lower than the objective point of any other point.


\subsection{Barrier Problems}
In interior point methods the boundaries of the variables are enforced through a barrier function, which keeps the objective function continuously differentiable.
A general, linear optimization problem can be associated with a barrier function
\begin{equation}
	B(x , \mu) = c^T x - \mu \sum_{i=1}^{n} \ln x_i \; ,
\end{equation} 
where the barrier parameter $\mu > 0$. For $\mu \to 0$ one recovers the original problem.
The optimization Lagrangian of the barrier problem is
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L}(x, \lambda, s) = c^T x - \mu \sum_{i=1}^{n} \ln x_i - \lambda^T (A x -b) \; ,
\end{equation}
where $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}^m$ is the Lagrange multiplier for the $A x = b$ constraint. Now, let $X = \mathrm{Diag}(x_1 , \ldots , x_n)$, $e = (1,1, \ldots , 1)^T$, $s = \mu X^{-1} e$, and $S = \mathrm{Diag}(s_1 , \ldots , s_n)$. Thereby the KKT conditions of the barrier problem can be stated as 
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
	A^T \lambda + s &= c \\
	A x &= b \\
	X S e &= \mu e \; .
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
By adding the barrier term the KKT complementary condition has been "relaxed", as it is no longer equals zero \cite{ipnote}. Again, for $\mu \to 0$ the original conditions are recovered. 


\subsection{Primal-Dual Interior Point Method}
Primal-dual methods optimize an additional, \textit{dual}, problem while optimizing the main, \textit{primal}, problem.
Consider the initial linear problem. Its dual is defined as 
\begin{align*}
	\max_{\lambda \in \mathbb{R}^n} \;  & \; b^T \lambda \\
	\text{subject to} \;  & \; A^T \lambda + s = c  \\
							& \; s \geq 0 \; .
\end{align*}
If either the primal or the dual problem has a solution, then so does the other, and the objective values are equal. If either problem is unbounded, then the other problem is infeasible. If a solution exists, then the optimal solution to the dual problem are the Lagrange multipliers to the primal problem and vice versa \cite{wright}. Note, how the dual of the dual problem is the original problem.
Hence, for primal-dual algorithms triplet of variables, $(x , \lambda , s)$, is considered when computing the optimum of a function.\\

The primal-dual interior point method computes a constrained Newton step, which is used to iterate the variables towards the optimum. Thisis done by solving a primal-dual barrier problem for a given $\mu$, yielding the optimum solution of said subproblem. The optimal solution of the main problem is found by solving these subproblems iteratively for ever decreasing $\mu$ using the previous solution as starting point \cite{ipopt}.\\
The solutions for the primal-dual subproblems are characterized by the KKT conditions. These conditions can be written into a single mapping
 \begin{align}
    F(x , \lambda, s) &= \begin{pmatrix}
           A^T \lambda + s - c \\
           A x - b \\
           X S e
         \end{pmatrix} = 0
  \end{align}
  which has the Jacobian
 \begin{align}
    J(x , \lambda, s) = \begin{pmatrix}
           0 & A^T & I	\\
           A & 0 & 0 	\\
           S & 0 & X
         \end{pmatrix}
  \end{align}
Thus, the Newton direction, $(x_B , \lambda_B , s_B)$, can be written as the solution to the system of equations
\begin{align}
J \begin{pmatrix}
           x_B \\
           \lambda_B \\
           s_B
         \end{pmatrix} = -F
\end{align}
This equation does not take into account the barrier function, however, as stated earlier, the effect of the barrier term is to relax the the KKT complementary condition. This is achieved by setting $X S e = \mu e$, whereby one obtains
\begin{align}
	\begin{pmatrix}
    	 0 & A^T & I    \\
         A & 0 & 0 		\\
         S & 0 & X
    \end{pmatrix} 
    \begin{pmatrix}
    	x_b 		    \\
        \lambda_B		\\
        s_B
    \end{pmatrix} =
    - \begin{pmatrix}
    	  A^T \lambda + s - c 	\\
          A x - b 				\\
          X S e - \mu e
    \end{pmatrix} \; . \label{eq:newtondirection}
\end{align}
Thereby the parameters can be iteratively updated through the calculated Newton direction
\begin{equation}
	(x_{k+1} , \lambda_{k+1} , s _{k+1}) = (x_{k} , \lambda_{k} , s _{k}) + \alpha  (x_B , \lambda_B , s_B) \; , \label{eq:newtonstep}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ can be found using a line-search or other more sophisticated methods.
The procedure above can be summarized in the following algorithm \cite{ipnote}:\\
\begin{algorithm}
\begin{algorithmic}
\caption{Primal-Dual Interior Point Algorithm}
\State Choose $\sigma \in (0,1)$ and $\mu_0 > 0$.
\State Choose initial point $(x_0 , \lambda_0 , s_0)$ within feasible region.
\For{$k = 1 , \ldots$}
	\State $\mu_k \gets \sigma \mu_{k-1}$
	\State Calculate the Newton direction using eq. \eqref{eq:newtondirection}.
	\State Compute step-size $\alpha$.
	\State Update parameters according to eq. \eqref{eq:newtonstep}
\EndFor
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The implementation of the interior point algorithm used in this thesis is from the IPOPT library \cite{Wachter2006}, which also approximates the Hessian of the optimization Lagrangian through previous derivatives using the L-BFGS algorithm \cite{Liu1989}. By including information about the second derivative, the algorithm is able to converge in much fewer iterations. 


\section{Quantum Speed Limit}
A subtlety of optimal control problems is that one is only searching for the control, $\boldsymbol{u}(t)$, which steers the initial state into the target-state at time $t = T$. It is often desirable to obtain the desired state in the shortest timespan possible. However, if a solution exists at $t= T_1$, it might not exist at $t = T_2 < T_1$. The shortest duration for which a solution can be found is called the \textit{quantum speed limit} (QSL). A large energy difference to orthogonal states allows for fast oscillations within a system, however, these differences cannot be arbitrarily large. Hence, a lower bound of how fast a system can evolve exists, which in turn leads to the QSL \cite{Caneva2009}.\\
There are several ways of approximating the quantum speed limit, however, there is no known way to reliably determine the QSL for a general state. Therefore, the best option is often to just solve the problem at increasingly shorter durations, until a solution no longer can be found [JJ].\\
If the initial state, $\ket{\psi_0}$, and the target-state, $\ket{\psi_{\mathrm{target}}}$, are orthogonal, one can estimate the QSL from the orthogonalization time, which is how long it takes for a state to become orthogonal to itself.
Consider $\ket{\psi (0)} = \sum_{n}^{\infty} c_n \ket{\phi _n}$, where $\hat{H} \ket{\phi _n} = E_n \ket{\phi _n}$. Following \cite{QSLtoffoli}, the norm squared of the survival probability is given as
\begin{align}
	|S(t)|^2 = |\braket{\psi (0) | \psi (t)}|^2 &= \sum_{n , m = 0}^{\infty} |c_n|^2 |c_m|^2 \cos \left( (E_n - E_m) t \right) \nonumber \\
	&\geq 1 + \frac{4 t}{\pi ^2} \dv{|S(t)|^2}{t} - \frac{4 t^2}{\pi} \Delta E^2 \; ,
\end{align}
where the trigonometric inequality $\cos x \geq 1 - \left( 4 x \sin x - 2 x^2 \right) / \pi^2$ was used, and $\Delta E$ is the energy spread of the state.
Since $|S(t)|^2 \geq 0$, then $\dv{|S(t)|^2}{t} = 0$ whenever $|S(t)| = 0$, which is the case at the orthogonalization time $t = \tau$. This leaves the inequality $0 \geq 1 - 4 \tau^2 \Delta E^2 / \pi^2$, yielding the Mandelstram Tamm bound when solved \cite{Mandelstam1991}
\begin{equation}
	\tau_{\mathrm{MT}} \geq \frac{\pi}{2 \Delta E} \; .
	\label{eq:MandelstamBound}
\end{equation}
Eq. \eqref{eq:MandelstamBound} sets a lower bound of the orthogonalization time, however, the bound was derived using a constant Hamiltonian. In the case of optimal control, the Hamiltonian is time dependent, which can be taken into account by using arguments from differential geometry \cite{Aharonov,beyondQSL}
\begin{equation}
	\tau_{\mathrm{MT}} \geq \frac{\pi}{2} \left( \int_{0}^{T} \Delta E \; \mathrm{d}t \right) ^{-1} \; , \label{eq:MTlimit}
\end{equation}
Equations \eqref{eq:MandelstamBound} and \eqref{eq:MTlimit} show how fast solutions require a large value of $\Delta E$. Since \ref{eq:MTlimit} is dependent on the control $\boldsymbol{u}(t)$, one would have to take an infimum over all controls connecting the initial and target state in order to evaluate the lowest value of the bound. This in itself is a task just as difficult as solving the control problem.\\
For an example of optimal control see Appendix \ref{chap:LZexample}, which illuminates some of the consequences of the quantum speed limit.
